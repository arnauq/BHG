\section{The integrator algorithm}

\section{Testing the algorithm}
In this section, we initialize our solver with initial conditions for known sceneraios: the existence of a circular orbit for photons at $R=\frac{3}{2}R_s$, and the planetary system formed by the Sun, the Earth and Jupiter (ignoring the effects of the planets to the metric).
\subsection{Photon geodesics}
The effective potential for massless particles is
\begin{equation}
	V(R) = \frac{L^2}{2R^2} - \frac{GML^2}{c^2R^3},
\end{equation}
which has an extremum at
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dV}{dR} = 0 \; ; \; R = \frac{3GM}{c^2} = \frac{3}{2} R_s,
\end{equation}
independently of its angular momentum. This corresponds to the circular photon orbit, which is unstable as we can clearly see from the shape of the effective potential in figure \ref{fig::veffphotons}.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Veff_photon.eps}
	\caption{Effective potential for a photon close to the black hole.}
	\label{fig::veffphotons}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We initialize a set of 15 photons, one of them at the expected circular orbit, with an arbitrarily chosen specific angular momentum $L=10^8$ $\si[per-mode=symbol]{\meter^2\per \second}$. The results are shown in figure \ref{fig::photon_geodesics}. As we can see, the photon with $R0=1.5R_s$ traces a circular orbit as expected, while the outer photons escape from the black hole and the inner ones get trapped. This is consistent with the extremum being a maximum, hence the circular orbit is unstable. Our integrator gives the same result even after thousands of revolutions, confirming its numerical stability. 
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{photon_geodesics.eps}
	\caption{Set of 15 photon orbits initialized at different radii. $R0=1.5$ confirms the photon circular orbit.}
	\label{fig::photon_geodesics}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Massive particle geodesics}
From [REF] the effective potential for massive particles is
\begin{equation}
	V(R) = \frac{c^2}{2} - \frac{GM}{R} + \frac{L^2}{2R^2} - \frac{GML^2}{c^2R^3},
\end{equation}
which differs from the Newtonian one by the last factor $\sim r^{-3}$ and the rest energy of the particle. We find the circular orbits at the extrema of the effective potential,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dV}{dr} = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	R_{\pm} = \frac{L^2 \pm \sqrt{ L^4 - \frac{12 G^2 M^2 L^2}{ c^2} } }{2 G M},
\end{equation}
that now depend on angular momenta as opposed to the massless case. The shape of the effective potential for different $L$ is plotted in figure \ref{fig::Veff_massive}
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Veff_massive.eps}
	\caption{Effective potential of massive particles for different values of the angular momentum.}
	\label{fig::Veff_massive}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
We initialize 6 massive particles with different angular momentum at the extrema position. We see that they indeed form circular orbits in figure \ref{fig::massive_geodesics}.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{massive_geodesics.eps}
	\caption{Set of 6 massive particle orbits initialized at different radii and angular momenta. $R_0=3$ confirms the innermost circular orbit.}
	\label{fig::massive_geodesics}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

There is a characteristic radius below which no circular orbits exist, 
\begin{equation}
	L^4 < \frac{ 12 G^2 M^2 L^2}{ c^2} \rightarrow L < \sqrt{12 } G M,
\end{equation}
which corresponds to $r<3 R_s$. No particle can orbit in a circular fashion inside this radius, in contrast to the Newtonian case.

\subsection{Newtonian limit: The Solar System}
The last check we perform is initializing the solver with a planteray system consisting of the Earth, Jupiter and the Sun as seen in figure \ref{fig::solarsystem}. The eccentricity of the orbits is $\varepsilon = 0.0034$ for the Earth and $\varepsilon=0.123$ for Jupiter. The disagreement on Jupiter's eccentricity (compared to the observed one) is due to ignoring the gravitational fields from other planets.
